         The project we are proposing is a redesign of the COMP 1950 website.   Our goal is to provide an interactive site that permits students to find their weekly lessons, assignments, quizzes, course information, resources, exercises and examples.  We will also provide information about the course curriculum, timetable, room information, grading, BCIT policies, and links to the main BCIT course registration site as well.

      <p class="info">
        Before starting we analyzed several other similar sites to get a feel for what other schools were offering.  And as avid users of the BCIT site we both already had a good feel for the weakness that we felt could be improved on.  The overall architecture is a website within a website which is confusing, and navigating around is not very fluidic.  Much of the information, exercises and homework assignments are buried inside the weekly lessons, which is difficult to find when returning later.   As a workaround I found myself emailing myself links to the assignments and notes so that they could be found again.  Also because it is a site within a site back clicking out of pages produces different results.  Also clicking on hyperlinks often fail, unless you right click and open in a new window.   Other then the few weaknesses, the site contains vast amounts of valuable content.

      <p class="info">
        Objective: To address the weaknesses of the original site, while maintaining all its great content.  The main improvements will be with the overall structure and eliminating the site within a site.  Additional improvements will be made to the menu system whereby we have broken out each individual category for Lectures, Homework Assignments, and Quizzes.  Lectures will still contain all the same content, however it will be accessible through the revised menu system.  We felt this approach would make it easier and faster to navigate to what is important.  In addition online quizzes for each Lecture will be provided such that students can rapidly assess their knowledge base.   In addition we will provide course information, resources, exercises and examples to students.  We will also attempt to provide information about the course curriculum, timetable, room information, grading, BCIT policies, and links to the main BCIT course registration site.

        <li>Design method: For this project we will be analyzing other CMS such as KPU, UBC, SFU, and BCIT.  We will be selecting the best attributes of each system to ensure state of the art performance, and that information is organized in an optimal format.   Also as part of or enviro-friendly philosophy, we will include a paperless format, whereby all content information, assignments, and quiz’s will be available online. </li>
        <li>Measured success: The site will attempt to organize the information in the most logical way possible but will include a feedback que so that students can make suggestions, rate the system, and provide feedback. </li>
